# Shift-Hours-and-payroll-sum
Hi, I know nothing of programming, but I would like to have an application to write down my work schedules that change daily.
An App as a calendar to write down my work schedule .
I would also like to have a summary of hours worked per week and month,
  attended work days and working hours that have additional payment in order to make a payroll simulation. 
Any help is welcome. Would you help me create this app ?
